# Overview

Do you want to perform easily search-replace in multiple files and file rename in one go ?
This utility allows you to group all your files in one giant file (like tar) but editor friendly.
The *archive* file is in fact a shell script regenerating the full tree structure.
You can then use your favorite editor to edit it  and do the required modifications (rename variables, class names, files, directories).



# Archive
# Unarchive
The giant file is in fact a shell script which generates all the needed file. Just run it preferably in a empty directory.
